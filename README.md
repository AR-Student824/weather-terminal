# weather-terminal
A wrapper for weather.ar-dev.cf for viewing weather information in the terminal, which is minimal, and predicts your location via your IP and displays weather for that location.

# Usage
`$ npm i weather69420`
`$ weather`

# More options will be available soon
This is just me making this package for 1 project a day for a week, and is low effort, and I plan to add more stuff to this soon.

# GUI
https://weather.ar-dev.cf - https://github.com/AR-Student824/weather
